## Remote Sensing - Winter Semester
Authors: Yrneh Ulloa, Severin Herzsprung

#### [Week 1](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk1_raster_processing_python.ipynb)
Learning basic pre-processing of raster data using Python.

#### [Week 2]()
Atmospheric correction of satellite images.

#### [Week 3](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk3%264_supervised_classification_with_super-pixel_segmentation.ipynb)
Creation of training polygons for classification of optical data. Afterwards, segmentation of a satellite image. 

#### [Week 4](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk3%264_supervised_classification_with_super-pixel_segmentation.ipynb)
Supervised classification using Random Forest.

#### [Week 5](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk5_hdf5_to_geotiff.ipynb)
After downloading a Night Light Image product, you need to convert the format from HDF5 to GeoTIFF. Afterwards, you can explore the data in QGIS.

#### [Week 6](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk6_Tweet_Analysis.ipynb)
Harvest some Twitter data and analyse the trends of the data.  

#### [Extra](https://github.com/yzut-ydv/Advanced_Remote_sensing_HM/blob/main/wk6_dataframe_pandas.ipynb)
Extra information on how to use the library Pandas for dataframe analysis. This is the core datatype of many products, including some text and raster data.
